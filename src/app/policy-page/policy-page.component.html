            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p> Shopbot Food, Inc. (“Shopbot Food,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This
                Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how we collect, use, disclose and protect Personal Information (as it
                is defined below) of our customers and users. It applies to all Personal Information collected by us on
                www.Shopbot Food.africa, the Shopbot Food mobile applications, and any other websites or mobile
                applications that link to this Policy, as well as during any written, electronic, and oral
                communications (collectively, the “Services”). Shopbot Food may collect Personal Information to help you
                place and receive orders and to improve the Shopbot Food service.

                Your access to and use of our Services are subject to our Terms and Conditions, which define some of the
                terms used throughout this Policy. Please make sure that you have carefully read and understand the

                Conditions, and accept our privacy practices described in this Policy. If you do not feel comfortable
                with any part of this Policy or our Terms and Conditions, you must not use or access our Services.

                The Company uses a network of independent third-party contractors (“Drivers” or “Couriers”) who provide
                delivery services to our users and food service providers. Drivers should refer to the Dasher Privacy
                Statement for information on how Shopbot Food collects and uses Drivers’ Personal Information.

                Our Services may change from time to time. As a result, we reserve the right to update or modify this
                Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. If we make any material changes to the
                way we process your Personal Information, we will notify you before such changes are effective. If you
                object to any changes, you must cease using our Services. We recommend you review this Policy
                periodically. This Policy became effective on the date indicated at the top of this page. Your continued
                use of our Services after any changes or revisions to this Policy indicates your agreement to the terms
                of the revised Policy.

                1. Collection of Personal Information

                your order details; information that you voluntarily provide to us; the nature of your communication;
                the purpose of the interaction, and the action we took in response to your inquiry or request.
            </p>
            <p>
                c. Information Collected Automatically
                We also may receive and store certain information about you and your device(s) automatically when you
                access or use our Site and Services. This information may include:

                Technical Information – We collect technical information associated with your activity on our Site and
                may include information related to your browser and operating system, IP address (the Internet address
                of your computer) unique device identifiers, and other information such as your device type. We use such
                information for diagnostic and statistical purposes and to administer our Services.

                Site Usage Information – We collect information to better understand customer traffic patterns and Site
                usage. This may include the webpage that you were visiting before accessing our Site or mobile
                application, the pages or features of our Site or mobile application that you browsed to inform us which
                part of our Site, app and Services you visit and how much time you spend there. This information is used
                to analyze and improve our Site and to provide our customers with a better user experience.

                Site Preferences – We collect information about your preferences to make your use of the Site more
                productive through the use of cookies.
            </p>

            <p>
                d. Location Information
                When you use the Services, we may collect and store general location information (such as IP address).
                If you permit the Services to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile
                operating system (“Platform”) or browser, we may also collect and store the precise location of your
                device when the Shopbot Food app is running in the foreground or background of your device. This
                information may be used to help you select your delivery address, to provide more accurate deliveries of
                your orders, to provide recommendations to you, and to enhance your user experience and improve the
                services. You can choose whether to enable the location tracking feature through the settings on your
                device or Platform or when prompted by the Shopbot Food mobile app. If you choose to disable the
                location feature, the Dasher will not receive precise location information from your device, which may
                compromise the accuracy of deliveries in some situations, for instance, if you are located in a large
                area, such as a park.
            </p>

            <p>
                e. Information Related to the Referral Program
                Shopbot Food allows users to invite friends and family to sign up for our Services. Sometimes we offer a
                promotional value for every friend or family member who signs up and places an order through your
                referral link. To help you do this, we may request you to grant us access to your mobile device address
                book. You can then direct us to send referral emails to contacts you select in your address book. By
                sending a referral, you also consent to Shopbot Food sending your public profile image to the contacts
                you select to receive a referral link. By choosing to invite a friend you represent that you have
                received the friend’s consent to provide his or her name and email address with us. Shopbot Food will
                use that information to send an email inviting him or her to visit the site and will store that
                information to track the success of the referral program and may send marketing emails. You can also
                send an SMS with a referral link to your contacts. If you use this option, you understand that Shopbot
                Food does not control the timing, content, or recipients of these SMS messages.

                Users may not send, publish, or share any false, misleading, or deceptive communications in connection
                with participation in the Referral Program. Such actions may violate various federal, state, and/or
                international laws, including, but not limited to, the regulations and policies promulgated by the
                Federal Trade Commission. Users may not send any referral emails, SMS messages, or other communications
                to children under the age of 13.

                If you are referred to Shopbot Food through one of our referral programs, or if someone attempts to
                refer you, we may share your name, whether you have already signed up for Shopbot Food, whether you are
                a new customer, and whether you have placed a qualifying order with Shopbot Food with the person(s) who
                referred you.
            </p>

            <p>
                f. Personal Information from Publicly Available Sources and Third Parties
                We may collect or receive Personal Information about you from publicly available sources, social network
                providers, marketing partners, and/or third parties. This may include:

                Social Network Information – We may receive information about you from other services. For example, we
                receive certain information from Facebook when you use their service to login to Shopbot Food.

                Demographic Information – This characteristic information could include information such as income,
                marital status, spending habits, and other information pertaining to customers.
            </p>

            <p>
                2. Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
                We use cookies, web beacons, pixels, session replay/screen capture, and similar technologies to collect
                information and personalize your experience with our Services. When we use session replay technology, we
                may collect on a real-time basis information on how you use and navigate the Services. This may include
                mouse movements and how you scroll through the Services, but we do not collect keystroke data.
                Additional information on other technologies we may use is set forth below.
            </p>

            <p>
                a. Cookies
                Cookies are small web files that a site or its provider transfers to your device’s hard drive through
                your web browser that enables the site’s or provider’s system to recognize your browser and remember
                certain information.

                How We Use Cookies – We use first-party and third-party cookies for the following purposes:

                to make our Services function properly;
                to improve our Services;
                to recognize you when you return to Shopbot Food and to remember information you have already provided,
                such as items already in your order cart;
                to collect information about your activities over time and across third party websites or other online
                services in order to deliver content and advertising tailored to your interests; and
                to provide a secure browsing experience during your use of our Services.
                How to Manage Cookies – You may disable the use of cookies by modifying your browser settings. If you
                choose to disable cookies you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our
                Services.

            </p>

            <p>
                b. Web Beacons
                Web beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs, are tiny graphics with a unique
                identifier that may be included on our Site to deliver or communicate with cookies, in order to track
                and measure the performance of our Site and Services, monitor how many web visitors we have, and to
                monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive,
                web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on webpages (or in an email).
            </p>

            <p>
                c. Online Analytics and Advertising Technologies
                We and our third-party vendors may use automated technologies (including cookie identifiers on our
                Site), along with other collected information, to tailor ads or deliver content when you are on our
                Services or on other devices, apps or websites.
            </p>

            <p>
                d. Interest-Based Advertising
                We (or our service providers) may use the information we collect, for instance, IP addresses and unique
                mobile device identifiers, to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or
                devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers), or work with providers that do this, in order to
                better tailor content and features and provide you with a seamless experience across devices. If you
                wish to opt out of cross device tracking for purposes of interest-based advertising, you may do so
                through your device settings. We may also use cross-device targeting to help identify our users and
                serve advertising. This type of advertising is often called “interest-based” or “personalized”
                advertising—and when it occurs on mobile apps, “cross-app” advertising.

                You can learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising
                by visiting (i) the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link or (ii) the Digital
                Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or
                customize Google display network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.

                Please note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive advertisements from us. However, in that
                case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above
                opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.
            </p>

            <p>
                e. Mobile Applications
                Depending on your permissions, we may receive your Personal Information from your Internet service and
                mobile device providers. Users of mobile devices who do not want to receive interest-based advertising
                may opt-out in several ways. Learn more about your choices for mobile devices by visiting
                http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices. Each operating system, (iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android
                devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery
                of tailored in-application advertisements. You should view your device or system “Settings” to determine
                how you can opt out of use of your device ID for “cross-app” personalized advertising.
            </p>

            <p>
                3. Use of Your Personal Information
                We may use the information we collect or receive about you for various purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
                a. To Provide You With the Services
                We use your information to provide you the Services. For example, we use credit card information to
                complete a transaction or an address to allow the Dasher to fulfill your delivery. If the applicable
                information is to be provided or Service is to be performed by a third party, then we will disclose the
                applicable Personal Information to the third party providing the information or performing applicable
                Services. Your information may be available or provided to third-party service providers and that are
                contractually obligated to protect your information as disclosed in this Policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                b. To Maintain, Improve, and Personalize the Services
                We use your information for our everyday business operations such as auditing, administration of the
                Services, forum management, fulfillment, and analytics. Your information may also be used to improve the
                content and/or functionality of the Services. We may use your information to help us improve offerings
                for Shopbot Food and/or our Merchants. We also use your information to personalize your experience. For
                example, we may personalize the content and features you see when visiting our Services. In addition, we
                may personalize advertisements, marketing communications, and recommendations to make them more tailored
                to your interests.
            </p>

            <p>
                c. To Communicate with You
                We use your information to communicate with you. For example, we may send you text messages or other
                notifications about the status of your orders and deliveries. We may also contact you with promotional
                offerings or other communications that may be of interest to you. If we send you marketing emails about
                services that may interest you, each email will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of
                receiving future email marketing communications.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the event you contact us, we use certain information to respond to your questions and assist you with
                any issues that may arise in your use of the Services. If you send text messages to a Dasher, using the
                telephone number for that Dasher available on the Services, we may use a third-party service provider to
                track and analyze these text messages. We track these text messages for fraud prevention, to ensure
                appropriate charging of fees, to enforce our Terms and Conditions, and for quality and training
                purposes. As part of this process, Shopbot Food and its service provider will receive in real time and
                store data about your text message, including the date and time of the text message, your phone number,
                and the content of the text message. You will not be able to opt out of transactional text messages
                between you and Drivers.
            </p>

            <p>
                d. For Account and Network Security Purposes
                We care about keeping you secure and safe while using our Services. Keeping you safe requires us to
                process your Personal Information, such as your device information, activity information and other
                relevant information. We use such information to combat spam, malware, malicious activity or security
                risks; improve and enforce our security measures; and to monitor and verify your identity so that
                unauthorized users do not gain access to your information.
            </p>

            <p>
                e. To Maintain Legal and Regulatory Compliance
                Our Services are subject to certain laws and regulations which may require us to process your Personal
                Information. For example, we process your Personal Information to pay our taxes, to fulfill our business
                obligations, ensure compliance with employment and recruitment laws or as necessary to manage risk as
                required under applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
                f. To Enforce Compliance with Our Terms and Conditions and Policies
                When you access or use our Services, you are bound to our Terms and Conditions and this Policy. To
                ensure you comply with them, we process your Personal Information by actively monitoring, investigating,
                preventing and mitigating any alleged or actual prohibited, illicit or illegal activities on our
                Services. We also process your Personal Information to: investigate, prevent or mitigate violations of
                our internal terms, agreements or policies; enforce our agreements with third parties and business
                partners.
            </p>
            g. To Protect You, Others, and Our Business
            We use your information to protect you, others, and our business, including, without limitation, using
            information for fraud prevention, for enforcement of our Terms of Service, to comply with the law, and to
            protect against security risks.

                information, or otherwise with your consent.

            <p>
                a. Service Providers

                services, marketing partners, web analytics, data processing, IT services, customer support and other
                services. These third-party service providers have access to your Personal Information only for the
                purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your
                Personal Information for any other purpose.
            </p>
            <p>

                Shopbot Food has implemented administrative, technical, and physical security controls that are designed
                to safeguard Personal Information. However, no online activity is ever fully secure or error-free. While
                we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information is absolutely
                secure. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any information to Shopbot Food.

                Please recognize that protecting your Personal Information is also your responsibility. We urge you to
                take every precaution to protect your information when you are on the Internet, or when you communicate
                with us and with others through the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters
                and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. If you have reason to believe that your interaction
                with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account might have been
                compromised), or if you suspect someone else is using your account, please let us know immediately by
                contacting us as indicated in the Contact Us section below.
            </p>

            <p>
                6. Data Retention
                We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide
                you services and to maintain a record of your transactions for financial reporting purposes. We will
                also retain and use your Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
                disputes, and enforce our agreements.
